# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Kickstarter is a popular self-funding online opportunity for donors of all monetary means to support different causes that they may not be able to sufficiently support if donations were provided individually.  Those with passions for causes use this platform to receive the donations to leverage for larger projects not possible with a limited pool of donors.  Our client Louise has a passion for the arts, supporting many different types of arts projects using Kickstarter funds.  Funds efficiently used for success are more likely to attract additional donors.  Louise is wanting specific updates on her theater projects to further leverage donations and productions.
### Purpose
The purpose of the analyses were to investigate how different fund raising campaigns fared her theater projects in relation to their launch dates and funding goals using Kickstarter for Louise.
## Analysis and Challenges
The data base was provided by the client.  This analysis including limiting data to the theater projects and conducting frequency analyses for the projects with the use of Excel pivot tables and resulting line graphs to feature the data.  The data required sorting, use of “countifs” commands and frequency reporting.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Successful fundraising campaigns ranged from 40% in December to a high of > 100% in May.  were more successful in the summer months of May, June, and July with another increase to over 60% of campaign success again in October.  Failed campaigns were lower in January and November during the years and highest in October and May.  Canceled campaigns were infrequent overall. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The next analysis included looking at the success, failure, and cancellation rate of projects related to their fundraising goal. The most successful and lowest failure rate percentage campaigns were less than $1000.  Three-fourths of these campaigns were successful (74.9%).  Success rates decrease steadily to the $30,000 to $34999 goal where there was an increase and then a drop off after the campaign goal increased to $45,000 and above.  Conversely the failure rates mirrored the success.  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
My challenges were more continuing adjusting to the world of commands and syntax.  Once the syntax was apparent, the rest of the project went well.  I was a fair user of Excel so everything we have fielded in the past week has been a huge learning curve and I struggled just adjusting to this mindset.  I have the experience with looking at data after it has been analyzed and am looking forward to getting better at making the data work for me as the class continues.Failed campaigns coincide with the higher number of successful campaign months suggesting that donors in general are possibly more generous.  Note that these peaks are associated with months after corporate tax filings are completed when donors are more aware of their need to increase their giving to reduce their tax liability.
A low number of canceled campaigns suggests that Louise is perceptive in finding projects of merit in theatre. January had the highest frequency of cancellations which is a time period when donors’ generosity likely were targeted to personal gift-giving over the holidays and possibly a lower interest to fund live theatre projects during the cold winter.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The high month of May was successful in 2015 when the economy overall had rebounded from recession.  Earlier years were less successful overall due to the global recession and less available discretionary to be provided by larger givers and corporations.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Smaller projects allow more small donors to enter the charity arena and they appear to be more likely to donate to projects they can easily feel they were a significant part of the success of that particular project.  The next increase in the successful project funding rate indicates a threshold where larger donors may be wanting to enter for their satisfaction of funding a large part of a project and/or may be the level of charitable giving needed to reduce their tax liability.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset captures only one benefactor of the arts.  Her network of donors are limited to those she has reached effectively through the mean of electronic public relations.  This limits the pool of donors who are “tech savvy” and interested to fund projects outside of their community.  Most donors prefer to support home communities and local educational institutions in arts projects such community theatre and concerts. Another limitation of this data set may be the types of data that was collected.  We have no knowledge of who her donors are or anything about them.  We have more summary data that is focused on the projects themselves.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
With this fairly large data set for an individual donor we could do some studies on relations of months, types of projects, and dollars involved with regression and analysis of variance to provide Louise a sharper focus than the line graphs we presented.  We could do tables on the different countries’ citizens providing funding for successful campaign and dollar amounts of giving to see where globally to focus her future fundraising efforts.  We could also look at the timespan of the projects to see what timespans seem to be the more successful.
